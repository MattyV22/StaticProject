# StaticProject
Static website AWS Console
I followed Tech With Lucy again on YT but i added a mix this time and also used CHATLLM for the index.html source as well as the bucket policy.
i added my own words and provided credit to the AI and AWS 
This process involed route 53 for a domain and a s3 bucket to host the website
Useing CHATLLM i asked for a japan theme to give it colour
i had to configure the text/plain into text/html as it was giving me a raw html website first but after changing to text/html through metadata i could then veiw the website correctly
